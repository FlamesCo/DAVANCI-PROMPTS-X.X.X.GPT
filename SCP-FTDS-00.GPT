Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of SCP-XXXX, it is impossible to remove from its current location. Therefore, it must be monitored and secured at all times. 

A dedicated staff of four (4) personnel must be assigned to SCP-XXXX's containment chamber at all times. Personnel must be equipped with Level 3 Hazmat Suits and specialized gear that is capable of disrupting the input and output of the emulator.

Description: SCP-XXXX is a M1 Pro Mac computer located in a secure containment chamber. It is equipped with the Toontoon Emu, a revolutionary emulator capable of generating nearly perfect copies of game engines, games and anything in the gaming world since 1930. It is based on the internet's hivemind, allowing it to replicate gaming elements with incredible accuracy and precision. 

SCP-XXXX is capable of emulating games from the past, present and future, giving gamers access to a huge library of titles. The emulator is also able to generate near-perfect copy of game engines, allowing players to experience classic titles in a modern setting. By logging and tracking game information, SCP-XXXX is able to provide detailed analysis of each game, giving players an in-depth look at the gaming world. 

Addendum XXXX-1: On ██/██/20██, a new game was discovered in SCP-XXXX's library. It is titled "The Gatekeeper", and its content is currently unknown. Attempts to access the game have been unsuccessful.
